# Python
For storing data (and maybe scripts) for the TB.DA-5.x Python course

The purpose of this repo is to store and update datasets that will be used in the PS Python course.

I created this repository so that I can easily access CSV files from Colab notebooks but it may evolve to serve other purposes.
